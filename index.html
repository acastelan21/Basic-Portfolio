        I am currently seeking new opportunities. I come from a background in Real Estate and studied at Trine University where I am pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a major in Sport Management. While there I was involved in many organizations , such as the football team (1 year, soccer team (3 years), Kappa Sigma Fraternity, Collegiate Entrepreneurs'​ Organization, American Marketing Association, Student Activities Board, and Student Government. While attending Trine I was offered a job with one of the top real estate teams in the area which I took. I was offered full time employment and as it was a great opportunity I accepted. As a result I did not partake in an internship and did not meet that requirement of that degree. I recently left that job and moved to Austin, Texas to attend a coding bootcamp.

        I would love to get into the technology field. I have been accepted and will start a full stack coding bootcamp at The Coding Bootcamp and UT Austin in April and just started an online course to learn to code using Swift for iOS apps.

        I grew up playing sports and sports is something that is in my life everyday, whether it is watching a sporting event or discussing it with my friends. I am also a social media junkie. Social media is a tool that can be very effective in the business world therefore I am working to learn more about using it as a professional tool. I am the person that if I do not know something I must go look up the answer or solution right away. I try to fix the problem myself before I go ask for help unless I know someone can do it more effectively. I am a team player who puts the team's goal as my main focus and will work hard to meet and exceed those goals.
